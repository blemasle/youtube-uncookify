# YouTube (un)cookify

Switch between regular YouTube's watch page and YouTube enhanced privacy (youtube-nocookie.com) website.
On Firefox, the page action button can be middle-clicked to open a new tab.

Also provides a context menu on YouTube watch links to directly open them into enhanced privacy mode.

## Why ?

YouTube enhanced privacy mode does not register watched video into your history. Plus, no more sign in and agreement pop ups ;)
